Underneath, the sculpted pod midsole incorporates ABZORB, ENCAP, and SBS cushioning for optimal comfort.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe most noteworthy feature of the New Balance 9060 Triple Black is its sculpted pod midsole, which includes ABZORB, ENCAP, and SBS cushioning. This aspect ensures enduring comfort, establishing the shoe as an excellent choice for everyday wear. The sneaker was originally sold for $150 on September 22nd, 2023.",

      "description": "The New Balance 9060 Triple Black Leather applies a black-on-black colorway and premium materials to the 9060‚Äôs technical silhouette.\n<br>\n<br>\nThis New Balance 9060 combines elements from two high-performance predecessors ‚Äì the 990 and the 860. While several technical features are borrowed from the 990, the sneaker‚Äôs style details come from the 860. The upper features black mesh with soft suede and synthetic leather overlays. The incorporation of mesh allows the foot to breathe and reduces the shoe‚Äôs overall weight. The overlays create a wavy pattern that complements the curves of the chunky midsole and rubber outsole. The signature New Balance ‚ÄòN‚Äô can be found on the side panels in tonal black leather.\n<br>\n<br>\nOur StockX experts like the addition of a stacked ABZORB midsole, which gives the shoe a semi-bulky appearance and reduces impact stress. The New Balance 9060 Triple Black Leather was released on September 24th, 2023, and retailed at $170.",

      "description": "The New Balance 9060 Bone Sparrow shoe, presenting in a natural inspired color scheme of bone and sparrow, boasts a chunky and bold silhouette and is designed for casual wear and light athletic activity.\n<br>\n<br>\nWhen the New Balance 9060 was being designed, it sparked a new word: retrofuturism. And the evidence of that word is present in this low-top shoe that is packed with New Balance‚Äôs sneaker tech while ebbing and flowing \"retro\" and \"futurism\" styles. The primarily bone colored upper is made out of suede, mesh, and synthetic materials which all work together to ensure it looks and feels great. Two different tilted Ns, sporting sparrow colored accents, adorn the sides, while additional branding is on the heel and tongue.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe particularly like sneaker tech designed with comfort in mind, such as the brand‚Äôs ABZORB midsole, ABZORB SBS heel, and the translucent CR device on the heel. The New Balance 9060 Bone Sparrow retailed for $150 when it was released on October 28, 2024.",
