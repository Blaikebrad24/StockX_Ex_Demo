Just below is Kobe's sheath logo. The embroidered inscription that reads: ‚ÄúThank you Kobe 04.12.2016 Mamba Out‚Äù really elevates this top into the stratospheric territory. It also features his player numbers, with a small white ‚Äú8‚Äù on the sleeve and a larger ‚Äú24‚Äù on the back. It is an inspiring and moving tribute to a basketball genius taken too soon. It's also the kind of top Kobe fans would wear every day if they could.\n<br>\n<br>\nOur StockX experts love its commemorative elements, which are tailor-made for collectors.
