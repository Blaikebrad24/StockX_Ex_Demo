      "description": "Inspired by the people, culture, and lifestyle of New York City, the ASICS Gel-NYC Cream Cloud Grey dresses the innovative silhouette in a neutral colorway of Cloud Grey and cream.\n<br>\n<br>\nOriginally designed by Angelo Baque, the Cream Cloud Grey ASICS Gel-NYC is a mashup of retro and contemporary influences. For example, the Gel-Nimbus 3 and the Gel-MC Plus V inform the upper, while the tooling system borrows from the Gel Cumulus 16. This gives the sneaker upgraded Gel cushioning in the heel and forefoot but also celebrates running shoes from the early 2000s through the bulky, layered upper. Breathable mesh in Cream makes up the base, while leather and synthetic overlays in Cloud Grey create a supportive, crisscross pattern on the side panels.\n<br>\n<br>\nOur experts at StockX like the padding around the collar and in the tongue because it adds comfort and contributes to the bulky aesthetic. The ASICS Gel-NYC Cream Cloud Grey was released on July 13, 2024, and sold for $130.",
